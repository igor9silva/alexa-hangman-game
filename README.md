# The Hangman Game for Alexa

A Hangman Game built for Alexa (using Alexa Skill Kit).

## Usage

Say something like `Alexa, start The Hangman Game` and it starts!

You can them interact with it guessing letters like:
- `Letter A`
- `P`
- `My guess is D`

If you feel lost at anytime, just ask Alexa how you're doing:
- `How many missing cases there are?`
- `Game status`
- `How am I doing?`

Or ask for help:
- `Help!`

And it'll tell you what to do!

## Live Demo

It's currently waiting for Amazon review so it can go live :)
